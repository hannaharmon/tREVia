## About
tREVia is a trivia game centering on the traditions and history of Texas A&M University. We first developed tREVia for HowdyHack 2023, a beginner hackathon organized by tamuhack for Texas A&M students. Everyone who has contributed to this project is a beginner to web development, and the project is by no means polished, but we are proud of what we've accomplished. We hope to continue improving tREVia as we learn more!
